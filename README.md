# 🎮 Unity Game Project

Currently in development by **Kay**.  

This project was originally hosted on someone else’s repository, so I’ve migrated it over to my own.  
I can provide proof of all commits if needed — just reach out.  

I’m building this game in my free time, with little to no prior Unity experience.  
That means you’ll probably find some *spaghetti code* here and there 🍝 — but it’s all part of the learning process.

## 🚧 Status
- Work in progress  
- Actively being developed  
- Expect bugs and messy code  

---

## ✨ About
This is a personal project where I’m experimenting, learning, and slowly piecing things together.  
Don’t expect AAA polish, but do expect passion.
